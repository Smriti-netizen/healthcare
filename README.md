           3)Fortis healthcare website: For writing customer reviews.
Problems:
1) To upload on github is the most difficult part, I was getting while adding files, then I search for those errors , and resolved using google and youtube .
2)To add javascript for the first time, in my very first attempt, although I still didn't fare upto my expectations.
3)Coupling pages
New Things:
1)Definitely , a lot of github.
2)Javascript, css attributes and more about html tags
3)Patience and preservence, not losing your spirits, at one time I decided to gave up on the competition, but , pursused on , and finally made my first full fledge website,by me.
